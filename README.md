| Document | Description |
|----|----|
| [Ð«](./doc/dlt_build_options.md) | The CMake build system provides a large amount of build options. They let you turn on or off certain features and provide alternative implementation details. |
| [LogStorage](doc/dlt_offline_logstorage.md) | The DLT Daemon as well as the DLT libary provide buffers for caching log data during absence of a consumer. However, some use cases require to write large amounts of log message e.g. to mass storages for long term storage or because no other means of exfiltrating the log data is available. |
